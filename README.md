## Working with Block Themes

Moiraine is a WordPress block theme with templates entirely composed of blocks, allowing you to edit all areas of your site — headers, footers, templates, and more.

### Key Concepts

- **Site Editor**: Access via `Appearance → Editor` to customize templates, styles, typography, and more
- **Patterns**: Pre-designed page elements accessible via the block inserter for quick page creation
- **Global Styles**: Modify colors, fonts, and layout defaults site-wide through the theme.json system
- **Template Parts**: Reusable components like headers and footers that appear across pages
- **Export**: Save your customizations as a theme zip file via the Site Editor options menu

### Using Full-Page Patterns

For best results with full-page patterns, apply the "No Page Title" template and ensure your design includes an H1 for SEO.
