- **JavaScript Architecture**: Added `initMenu` callback with `data-wp-watch` integration for proper initialization timing and streamlined action methods for cleaner state updates
- **Menu Designer Block Responsiveness**: Improved CSS width constraints to prevent horizontal scrollbars and implemented intelligent viewport-aware positioning system using CSS container queries
- **Block Editor Integration**: Menu Designer block now appears in navigation block inserter when adding menu items
- **ES Module Configuration**: Implemented proper `viewScriptModule` configuration with `--experimental-modules` build flag for modern WordPress Interactivity API support

### Fixed
- **Menu Designer Block Navigation Integration**: Fixed critical issue preventing Menu Designer block from being inserted as navigation menu items

- **Menu Designer Script Loading**: Fixed critical issue where view.js script wasn't being enqueued using auto-scan block registration method
- **Menu Designer CSS Positioning**: Fixed responsive width constraints using `min()` function to prevent overflow on smaller viewports and implemented CSS container queries with `clamp()` positioning to prevent horizontal scroll bars when mega menus extend beyond viewport boundaries
- **Menu Designer Width Management**: Fixed restrictive 300px minimum width constraint causing narrow desktop dropdowns by implementing dynamic width calculation with `max-content` and viewport-aware sizing
- **Template Part Integration**: Fixed template parts not appearing in Menu area by properly registering menu template parts in `theme.json`
- **Template Part Expansion**: Fixed template parts not displaying at full width within mega menus by adding CSS overrides for width constraints in menu context
- **Mobile Menu Responsiveness**: Enhanced mobile breakpoint handling with proper width resets while maintaining desktop improvements
- **Build Process Enhancement**: Added `--experimental-modules` flag to webpack build process enabling proper view.js compilation
