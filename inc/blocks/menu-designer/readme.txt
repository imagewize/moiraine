== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a Menu Designer block to my navigation? =

Within your Navigation block, click the "+" button to add a new menu item. Search for "Menu Designer" in the block inserter and add it as a navigation menu item.

= Where do I create template parts for mega menu content? =

Go to Site Editor → Template Parts → Menu area. Create new template parts or use the pre-built ones included with the theme (menu-card-simple, menu-panel-features, etc.).

= Why doesn't my Menu Designer block show template part options? =

Ensure your template parts are assigned to the "Menu" area. The block only displays template parts specifically created for the menu area.

= Can I customize the mega menu styling? =

Yes! The block includes layout controls for width (content/wide/full) and justification (left/center/right). Additional styling can be applied through theme customization.
