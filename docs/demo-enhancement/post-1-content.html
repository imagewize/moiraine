<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Block Themes?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Block themes represent a fundamental shift in WordPress development. Introduced with Full Site Editing (FSE) in WordPress 5.9 and refined through version 6.0 and beyond, block themes allow you to design and customize every part of your website—from headers to footers, from blog archives to single posts—using the intuitive block editor interface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike traditional themes that rely on PHP template files and require coding knowledge to customize, block themes use a visual editor for all aspects of your site. This means you can modify your site's layout, typography, colors, and structure without ever touching a line of code.</p>
