## Image Sourcing Workflow

### Step 1: Unsplash Downloads

**Avatar Images:**
```bash
# Create download directory
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/moiraine-images/avatars
cd ~/Downloads/moiraine-images/avatars

# Download high-quality images from Unsplash
# Search terms documented above for each avatar
# Save as original filenames for tracking
```

**Workspace Images:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/moiraine-images/workspace
cd ~/Downloads/moiraine-images/workspace

# Download based on search terms above
```

### Step 2: Image Processing

**Resize and Crop:**
```bash
# Avatars: Square crop to 400x400px
# Workspace: Resize to 1920x1080px (maintain aspect ratio)
# Logos: Design at 400x200px (2:1 ratio)
```

**Convert to WebP:**
```bash
# Install webp tools if not already installed
brew install webp

# Batch convert avatars
cd ~/Downloads/moiraine-images/avatars
for img in *.jpg; do
  cwebp -q 85 "$img" -o "${img%.jpg}.webp"
done

# Batch convert workspace images
cd ~/Downloads/moiraine-images/workspace
for img in *.jpg; do
  cwebp -q 85 "$img" -o "${img%.jpg}.webp"
done
```

### Step 3: Optimization

**Check File Sizes:**
- Avatars: Target < 50KB
- Workspace images: Target < 150KB
- Logos: Target < 30KB

**Adjust Quality if Needed:**
```bash
# If file too large, reduce quality
cwebp -q 75 input.jpg -o output.webp

# If file still too large, resize first
# Use ImageMagick or Preview.app on macOS
```

### Step 4: Rename and Deploy

```bash
# Rename to match Moiraine naming convention
mv downloaded-avatar-1.webp avatar-1.webp
mv downloaded-avatar-2.webp avatar-2.webp
# ... etc

# Copy to theme directory
cp *.webp /Users/jasperfrumau/code/imagewize.com/demo/web/app/themes/moiraine/patterns/images/

# Backup old images first
cd /Users/jasperfrumau/code/imagewize.com/demo/web/app/themes/moiraine/patterns/images
mkdir -p backup-ollie-$(date +%Y%m%d)
cp avatar-*.webp computer-hands.webp desktop.webp guy-laptop.webp logo-*.webp backup-ollie-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```
