# Archived Patterns

This directory contains patterns that were not actively used on the demo site as of December 2025.

## Archive Date
December 9, 2025

## Reason for Archiving
We are moving away from Ollie patterns to create our own custom patterns that make Moiraine more unique. These patterns are kept here for reference purposes only as we develop our own pattern library. Our goal is to differentiate Moiraine from Ollie and establish a distinct design identity.

## Patterns Archived
89 patterns were moved to this archive directory.

## Active Patterns Remaining
19 patterns are still active and in use:
- blog-post-columns.php
- card-details.php
- contact-side-by-side.php
- faq.php
- feature-boxes-with-button.php
- hero-call-to-action-buttons-light.php
- hero-dark.php
- hero-light.php
- hero-text-image-and-logos.php
- numbers.php
- pricing-table.php
- services-feature-cards.php
- single-testimonial.php
- team-members.php
- testimonial-highlight.php
- testimonials-and-logos.php
- testimonials-with-big-text.php
- text-call-to-action-buttons.php
- text-call-to-action.php

## Future Plans
These patterns are archived for reference only. The plan is to eventually replace them with custom Moiraine-specific patterns that better reflect our unique design vision and move further away from Ollie's influence.

## Restoration (If Needed)
If you temporarily need any pattern from this archive, simply move it back to the `patterns/` directory. However, consider creating a custom pattern instead to maintain our goal of differentiation.

## Location
This archive directory is located at the theme root level (`demo/web/app/themes/moiraine/archive/`) to avoid any potential conflicts with WordPress pattern loading from the `patterns/` directory. The archive is excluded from theme builds via `.distignore`.

## Multisite Verification
All subsites in the demo multisite network (main site, SPA, and Auctor) were checked to ensure no archived patterns are in use.

## Categories of Archived Patterns
- Headers (7 patterns)

- Menus (12 patterns)
